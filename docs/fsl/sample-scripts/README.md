# Sample Scripts

Reference scripts demonstrating the Foreigners scripting language.

## Files

### `mvp.foreigners`
Uses **only MVP syntax** — what we're building first. This script should work with the initial implementation.

**Features used:**
- `seed:` for determinism
- `#` comments
- `@location` declarations
- `character: text` dialogue
- `[[emotion]]` inline tags
- `...` silent beats
- Emotion stickiness (last emotion persists)

### `future-imagination.foreigners`
A **vision script** that imagines the full future syntax working together. This won't run until we implement these features, but it shows where the language can go.

**Additional features imagined:**
- `[title-card]` scenes with text/duration/background
- `[transition]` with jingle and style
- `[music:]` and `[sfx:]` audio cues
- `[camera:]` movements (pan, zoom, wide, close-up)
- `[action]` character movements
- `[pause:]` explicit timing
- `[narrator]` voiceover
- `[[angle]]` modifiers (front, side)
- `[[emotion:variant]]` specific variant selection
- `[[close-up]]` shot type inline

*These scripts serve as our "quick brown fox" — comprehensive examples to test and demonstrate the language.*
